  The password requirement is not even fully enumerated. Upon inspection of the source code, the following lines were found, hidden by javascript: "Must include at least %MINSPECIAL of the following characters:-.~!@#&_{}|:$%^*()=[];?/+"

  The actual list of special characters that are prohibited is correctly enumerated there. It's a result of [`a misapplication`](https://cibng.ibanking-services.com/cib/scripts/jquery/custsvc/custSvcChangePassword.js) of the [`variable allowedSpecialCharacters found here`](https://cibng.ibanking-services.com/cib/scripts/jquery/custsvc/fis-visual-validator.js?version=20180507).

  It took under 5 minutes to find the bug after looking at the source for the first time. This is a bank.
