  Max 15 characters, min 8. You cannot use **ANY** special characters -
  alpha-numerics only. This amazingly terrible password policy combines
  with a known phrase (The "Memorable Information") of which you will be
  asked for a random 3 characters of if you get your password right.
  This phrase has similar alpha-numeric restrictions applied.
