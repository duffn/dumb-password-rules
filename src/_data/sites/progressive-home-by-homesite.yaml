  Password must be a minimum of 8 characters.

  Passwords must have one lowercase character.

  Passwords must have one uppercase character.

  Passwords must have one number.

  Passwords must have one special character in the following list: ``!'#$ ~`!@#$%^&*()-_+=?<,>.{}[]|;:``

  Furthermore, when resetting your password using this URL, it allows for up to 20 (i haven't tested past this) characters.

  However, when you log in, it only allows passwords up to 12 characters in length. So that newly created password will work once and only once.
