  Your password can not exceed a length of 30 characters. However, they don't tell you this: If you try to set a longer password, they instead shame *you* for not including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit and one symbol â€“ *even if you did*.

  The error message translates to:

  > The password must contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
