  Passwords:
  1. Must contain at least 8 characters;
  2. Must contain at least 3 out of 4 types of characters
  (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, special characters);
  and
  3. Must not contain
  "the user's account name or parts of the user's full name
  that exceed two consecutive characters".

  **New passwords are silently truncated to 30 characters.**
  Inspecting the change password input field
  reveals a ``maxlength="30"`` attribute,
  but this isn't obvious to the average user because
  the field isn't physically wide enough to see the truncation.
  There is no warning or error message.

  If you subsequently try to login with the untruncated password,
  it doesn't work because the password input field on the *login* page
  *doesn't* have a ``maxlength="30"`` attribute
  (and neither does the input field for Outlook email).

  Passwords must be changed every 6 months.
