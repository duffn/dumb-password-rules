  Causes:
  * Your two-factor authentication code must be appended to the end of the password
  * Passwords have a limit of 32 characters

  Effect:

  If your account has a 32-character password and has two-factor authentication,
  their system appears to cut off the token, making it impossible to login.
  You must reduce your password to 26 characters in order to login with a token.
