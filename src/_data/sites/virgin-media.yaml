  Your password needs to be between 8 and 10 characters long, with no
  spaces, and must contain only numbers and letters. The first character
  must be a letter.

  Feb 2020 Update: policy remains the same but the description is hidden
  leaving you to guess the acceptable length/chars.  Users are now left
  with helpful hints after JS validation.
