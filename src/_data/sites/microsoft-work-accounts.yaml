  "What doesn't seem to be a problem for personal accounts, is for work\n\
  accounts from Microsoft (e.g. Office 365 etc.).\n\nMaximum 16 characters. So forget\
  \ about using your new fancy diceware\npassword here - or really any secure passwords\
  \ in general.\n\nOh - and besides that, please don't use any \"exotic\" symbols, like\
  \ \xA4 or\n\u20AC. Or the letters \xC6, \xD8 or \xC5 from the Danish alphabet. They\
  \ all are\nsupposedly \"spaces\"."
