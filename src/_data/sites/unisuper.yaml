  Passwords need:
  - a lower case letter
  - a number
  - a capital letter
  - at least 8 characters

  In the 'Change password' form,
  passwords are now restricted to a `maxlength` of 18.

  If your current password is longer than 18 characters,
  you won't be able to change your password.
  When I contacted them about this,
  they "passed on" my "experience and concerns" for review
  and simply reset my password.

  Now I wish I'd just said nothing and kept my 50-character password.
