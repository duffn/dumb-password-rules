  It only accepts lowercase letters, uppercase letters and numbers (any
  other character counts as forbidden character).
  Also, if your password contains any invalid character, it will get
  marked as "Identical to the former 10 passwords".

  To make it more fun, during the registration, it allows to set a 24
  characters password to login to their website.
  Once you try to login with the password, it will say that the maximum
  length accepted is 16 characters.
  What actually happens, is that they let you insert 24 characters
  during registration, but only the first 16 will get actually used as
  password.
