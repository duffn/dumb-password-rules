  Telekom's MyWorkplace is a Single Sign On / login hub for their
  Open Telekom Cloud which is basically an Amazon AWS clone. It's
  rather new and especially for business customers. Especially
  because it is for business customers, there's absolutely no reason
  to limit a password to 16 characters. Even special characters are
  limited to a certain set.
