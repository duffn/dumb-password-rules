  When registering in *Mi O2* app, password length must be exactly 7 or 8 characters (numbers and letters only). 
  As O2 is part of Telef√≥nica (Movistar), it seems to use the same backend (at least in Spain), so it has the [`same password requirements`](https://dumbpasswordrules.com/sites/movistar/).
