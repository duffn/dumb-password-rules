  This was very painful to find a password that works with this one and that I can actually remember (I ended-up using my bank-account number because everything else failed). It took me maybe one hour and I thought I would become crazy (and yes, the session expires frequently while you are actually thinking about a password).
  - The password must be more than 8 characters
  - But you cannot use more than 13 characters
  - You can only use digits
  - You cannot use your birthdate or your login
  - You cannot use a sequence of digits (if your password happens to contain 56 or 89 it will be rejected)
  - You cannot repeat the same character (if your password contains 22 or 55 it will be rejected)
