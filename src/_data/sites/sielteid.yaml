  Sielte is one of the four Italian digital identity providers of level 3 (the highest available).

  The rules are as such:
  - At least 8 characters
  - At most 16 characters
  - Must have both lower and upper characters
  - Must have one or more digits and one or more of the following "special characters": `~!@#$%^&*()_-+={}[]\|:;"'<>,.?/-`
  - Must not have more than two identical consecutive characters

  Italian vowels with accents are considered to be invalid.

  Both the old and the new password are sent to the server without being hashed first. Validation happens on the server side only.
