  „Sparkasse“ is a group of banks which is pretty popular in Germany. It
  calls its passwords „PIN“ („persönliche Identifikations-Nummer“ —
  personal identification number), the rules are pretty horrific and its
  not even a number, even though it is called as such! Here is a
  screenshot from the branch where I am from (Jena, Germany), but since
  they have a central IT, I think it will be identical in other branches:

  The rules are as such:

  -  Only 5 characters
  -  Small letters (a-z)
  -  Large letters (A-Z)
  -  Numbers (0-9)
  -  „Special“ characters: ä,ö,ü,Ä,Ö,Ü and ß (Not suprising for a german
    Company)

  After the rules there some hints on how the password should not look
  like:

  -  Combinations of your initials and the birthyear
  -  Your phone number or parts thereof
  -  Your zipcode
  -  Commom combinations like 123ab or 55555
  -  Full or parts of your login credentials

  They also have this Android app for 2FA (called Push-TAN), but the rules are
  diffrent:

  - At least 8 characters
  - At least one digit
  - At least one special character
  - Upper- and lowercase letters
