  The password rules itself is fine, but, it doesn't inform about the max length of the password.
  Their max length is 14 characters, so even if you enter a password of 42 chars, you can login with the first 14 of it.
  In this case, I changed my password to **Super_l0ng_password_that_fits_all_criteria**, and could login with **Super_l0ng_pas**

  > Thank you for your e-mail.
  > Our website only takes 14 characters as a password, so somehow when you registered it took all 49.
  > But since our website only asks for 14 characters anything after will be valid.
  > I would advice you to change your password.
  > Have a wonderful day.
