description: |-
  - between 8 and 30 characters
  - at least one number or special character
  - not part of email address
  - avoid common passwords
  - repeating characters 3 or more times should be avoided
  - currency characters and 3 or more consecutive characters, also in reverse order, should be avoided
  Somehow "$" is not counted as a currency character, but as a special character. Moreover, as soon as the password contains "€", "£" or "元" for example, it is regonized as a common password.
  Hence "76eHnE6OH€OCmv4ZGo30#Oe^@gdw^@" does not fulfill the requirements while "qwerty$$" does.
