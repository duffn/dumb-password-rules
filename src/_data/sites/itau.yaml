  I know, it's in spanish, let me translate this monstrosity for you.

  - Allowed characters: letters A to Z uppercase or lowercase (ñ is not allowed), number 0 to 9, #, $, %, &, +, -, . :, ;, _.
  - You must use 8 characters.
  - The password must contain at least one letter and at least one number.
  - You can't repeat the same character more than two times in a row.
  - Avoid using basic character sequences such as "qwerty", "asdf", "1234" or "9876".

  _Just in case, that's eight characters. Not seven, not nine. That's bad and insecure enough... What they don't tell you is that the passwords are are actually **not** case sensitive._
