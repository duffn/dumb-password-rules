name: Banque de Tahiti
description: |-
  You have to enter your password using this *very* Frenchy keypad.  You don't have lowercase letters, the blanks are not spaces but just non-clickable gaps, but as a compensation you have some weird symbols that your keyboard does not have a key for (e.g. `Âµ`).

  No accessible version available.
