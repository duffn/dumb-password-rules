This was very painful to find a password that works with this one and that I can actually remember (I ended-up using my bank-account number because everything else failed).

- But you cannot use more than 13 characters
- You can only use digits
- You cannot use your birthdate or your login
- You cannot use a sequence of digits (if your password happens to contain 56 or 89 it will be rejected)

`CenturyLink <https://eam.centurylink.com/eam/login.do>`__

So many bad ideas: a low maximum length, requiring six specific character types while not accepting common symbols,
plus a weird restriction that makes random generation harder.

|CenturyLink|

`CenturyLink Residential <https://eam.centurylink.com/eam/mySettings.do>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your password is too long. But how long can it be? Oh, we won't tell you.

* Unlisted prohibited characters

|CloverSecurity|


`Commsec <https://www2.commsec.com.au/selfservice/resetpassword>`__

|DJI|


`Dnevnik.ru <https://login.dnevnik.ru/login>`__

Silently (sic!) trim password to 30 symbols.

That causes the stupid case when you could successfully registrate an account with password length of 52 and can't login with the password.

|IBM|


`IBM TSO/E Logon terminal <https://www.ibm.com/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It might not be a web site, but that does not make it less dumb.
Since many don't know about IBM mainframes, it seems they don't think you need to up the policies.

Default old password policy is: 6-8 characters long, A-Z, 0-9

Over the last few years they have updated their policies a bit, but due to many of their
subsystems are incompatible, they can't enforce the new options for safer passwords.

No more, no less than 5 digits. This is the password you use to log in and to confirm
online transactions. They used to have "normal" passwords and they forced everybody to
change to the 5 digits versions. They said they've made it "so it's easier for you" and it's
OK, because everybody has 2FA.

|ING Romania|


`Inria <https://vpn1-roc.national.inria.fr/+CSCOE+/logon.html>`__

not even a number, even though it is called as such! Here is a
screenshot from the branch where I am from (Jena, Germany), but since
they have a central IT, I think it will be identical in other branches:

The rules are as such:

-  Only 5 characters

-  Large letters (A-Z)
-  Numbers (0-9)
-  „Special“ characters: ä,ö,ü,Ä,Ö,Ü and ß (Not suprising for a german
   Company)

After the rules there some hints on how the password should not look
like:

-  Combinations of your initials and the birthyear
-  Your phone number or parts thereof
-  Your zipcode
-  Commom combinations like 123ab or 55555
-  Full or parts of your login credentials

`Trade Me <https://www.trademe.co.nz>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Won't allow spaces or single quotes. Maybe other characters as well -
they do not say up front - but the password they accepted contained lots
of other special characters.

|TradeMe|


`TreasuryDirect <https://www.treasurydirect.gov/RS/UN-Display.do>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Will allow most passwords longer than 8 characters. Doesn't tell you there is a
maximum length of 16 characters. Then forces you to type it with an on-screen keyboard
with no capital letters.

|Treasury1|

|Treasury2|


`TwinSpires <https://www.twinspires.com/account/register>`__

`Unicaja <https://areaprivada.unicajabanco.es/PortalServlet?pag=1533643502465&np=S>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Username is your national Spanish ID (easy to find).
Your password must be 6 characters long. You can't type, only select characters from the virtual keyboard

|Unicaja|


`UniSuper <https://www.unisuper.com.au/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passwords need:

- a lower case letter
- a number
- a capital letter
- at least 8 characters

In the 'Change password' form,
passwords are now restricted to a ``maxlength`` of 18.

If your current password is longer than 18 characters,
you won't be able to change your password.
When I contacted them about this,
they "passed on" my "experience and concerns" for review
and simply reset my password.

Now I wish I'd just said nothing and kept my 50-character password.

|UniSuper|


`United Parcel Service of America <https://www.ups.com/doapp/signup>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your password must:

- Be between 7 and 26 characters long
- Contain at least 1 lowercase character
- Contain at least 1 uppercase character
- Contain at least 1 number character
- Contain one special character (!@#$%*)
- NOT contain first or last name

`United States Postal Service <https://reg.usps.com/entreg/secure/ChangePasswordAction_input>`__

`University of California San Diego <https://www.ucsd.edu>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passwords must be between 8 and **11** characters long!

|University of California San Diego|


`University of Texas at Austin <http://www.utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because of the last two rules, which ban dictionary words and any
variants using symbol substitutions, *neither* of the passwords
presented in the `xkcd comic <https://xkcd.com/936/>`__ are allowed.

|University of Texas as Austin|


`University of Western Australia (Pheme) <https://www.pheme.uwa.edu.au/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Passwords:

1. Must contain at least 8 characters;
2. Must contain at least 3 out of 4 types of characters
   (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, special characters);
   and
3. Must not contain
   "the user's account name or parts of the user's full name
   that exceed two consecutive characters".

**New passwords are silently truncated to 30 characters.**
Inspecting the change password input field
reveals a ``maxlength="30"`` attribute,
but this isn't obvious to the average user because
the field isn't physically wide enough to see the truncation.
There is no warning or error message.

If you subsequently try to login with the untruncated password,
it doesn't work because the password input field on the *login* page
*doesn't* have a ``maxlength="30"`` attribute
(and neither does the input field for Outlook email).

Passwords must be changed every 6 months.

`USAA Bank <https://www.usaa.com/inet/pages/security_take_steps_protect_logon>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Password cannot be longer than 12 characters but they don't tell you that until after you try a new password. To make up for this fact they've added dubious additional security features on top of this weak foundation.


|USAA|


`URSSAF (French employers tax collection service) <https://www.autoentrepreneur.urssaf.fr>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When setting a new password:
Password must be exactly 8 characters, at least 1 letter, at least 1 number, but no special characters.

`Vio Bank <https://www.viobank.com>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The password requirement is not even fully enumerated. Upon inspection of the source code, the following lines were found, hidden by javascript: "Must include at least %MINSPECIAL of the following characters:-.~!@#&_{}|:$%^*()=[];?/+"

The actual list of special characters that are prohibited is correctly enumerated there. It's a result of `a misapplication <https://cibng.ibanking-services.com/cib/scripts/jquery/custsvc/custSvcChangePassword.js>`__ of the `variable allowedSpecialCharacters found here <https://cibng.ibanking-services.com/cib/scripts/jquery/custsvc/fis-visual-validator.js?version=20180507>`__.

It took under 5 minutes to find the bug after looking at the source for the first time. This is a bank.

spaces, and must contain only numbers and letters. The first character
