This was very painful to find a password that works with this one and that I can actually remember (I ended-up using my bank-account number because everything else failed). It took me maybe one hour and I thought I would become crazy (and yes, the session expires frequently while you are actually thinking about a password).

- The password must be more than 8 characters
- But you cannot use more than 13 characters
- You can only use digits
- You cannot use your birthdate or your login
- You cannot use a sequence of digits (if your password happens to contain 56 or 89 it will be rejected)

`CenturyLink <https://eam.centurylink.com/eam/login.do>`__

| It only accepts lowercase letters, uppercase letters and numbers (any
  other character counts as forbidden character).
| Also, if your password contains any invalid character, it will get
  marked as "Identical to the former 10 passwords".

| To make it more fun, during the registration, it allows to set a 24
  characters password to login to their website.
| Once you try to login with the password, it will say that the maximum
  length accepted is 16 characters.
| What actually happens, is that they let you insert 24 characters
  during registration, but only the first 16 will get actually used as
  password.

Their max length is 14 characters, so even if you enter a password of 42 chars, you can login with the first 14 of it.
In this case, I changed my password to **Super_l0ng_password_that_fits_all_criteria**, and could login with **Super_l0ng_pas**

Sparda is a group of German banks. They all use the same login form (except for Sparda-Bank Berlin, see below). Their equivalent of a password is called *Online-PIN*. As the name implies, only digits are allowed. (*Zifferneingabe* means "digit input"; it opens an on-screen number pad widget.)

Not mentioned explicitly: Your PIN is limited to 6 characters, i.e. the range of valid "passwords" is from ``000000`` to ``999999``.

|Sparda M 2|

The odd one out is Sparda-Bank Berlin, which has different rules:

- At least 8 characters.

`Sparkasse <https://s-jena.de>`__

„Sparkasse“ is a group of banks which is pretty popular in Germany. It
calls its passwords „PIN“ („persönliche Identifikations-Nummer“ —
personal identification number), the rules are pretty horrific and its
not even a number, even though it is called as such! Here is a
screenshot from the branch where I am from (Jena, Germany), but since
they have a central IT, I think it will be identical in other branches:

|Sparkasse Jena|

The rules are as such:

-  Only 5 characters
-  Small letters (a-z)
-  Large letters (A-Z)
-  Numbers (0-9)
-  „Special“ characters: ä,ö,ü,Ä,Ö,Ü and ß (Not suprising for a german
   Company)

After the rules there some hints on how the password should not look
like:

-  Combinations of your initials and the birthyear
-  Your phone number or parts thereof
-  Your zipcode
-  Commom combinations like 123ab or 55555
-  Full or parts of your login credentials

They also have this Android app for 2FA (called Push-TAN), but the rules are
diffrent:

- At least 8 characters
- At least one digit
- At least one special character
- Upper- and lowercase letters
