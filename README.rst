This was very painful to find a password that works with this one and that I can actually remember (I ended-up using my bank-account number because everything else failed).

- But you cannot use more than 13 characters
- You can only use digits
- You cannot use your birthdate or your login
- You cannot use a sequence of digits (if your password happens to contain 56 or 89 it will be rejected)

Oh - and besides that, please don't use any "exotic" symbols, like ¤ or

supposedly "spaces".

| It only accepts lowercase letters, uppercase letters and numbers (any
  other character counts as forbidden character).
| Also, if your password contains any invalid character, it will get
  marked as "Identical to the former 10 passwords".

| To make it more fun, during the registration, it allows to set a 24
  characters password to login to their website.
| Once you try to login with the password, it will say that the maximum
  length accepted is 16 characters.
| What actually happens, is that they let you insert 24 characters
  during registration, but only the first 16 will get actually used as
  password.

- At least 8 characters.

`Sparkasse <https://s-jena.de>`__

„Sparkasse“ is a group of banks which is pretty popular in Germany. It
calls its passwords „PIN“ („persönliche Identifikations-Nummer“ —
personal identification number), the rules are pretty horrific and its
not even a number, even though it is called as such! Here is a
screenshot from the branch where I am from (Jena, Germany), but since
they have a central IT, I think it will be identical in other branches:

|Sparkasse Jena|

The rules are as such:

-  Only 5 characters
-  Small letters (a-z)
-  Large letters (A-Z)
-  Numbers (0-9)
-  „Special“ characters: ä,ö,ü,Ä,Ö,Ü and ß (Not suprising for a german
   Company)

After the rules there some hints on how the password should not look
like:

-  Combinations of your initials and the birthyear
-  Your phone number or parts thereof
-  Your zipcode
-  Commom combinations like 123ab or 55555
-  Full or parts of your login credentials

They also have this Android app for 2FA (called Push-TAN), but the rules are
diffrent:

- At least 8 characters
- At least one digit
- At least one special character
- Upper- and lowercase letters
