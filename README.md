### [Sparkasse](https://s-jena.de)

„Sparkasse“ is a group of banks which is pretty popular in Germany. It calls its passwords „PIN“ („persönliche Identifikations-Nummer“ — personal identification number), the rules are pretty horrific and its not even a number, even though it is called as such! Here is a screenshot from the branch where I am from (Jena, Germany), but since they have a central IT, I think it will be identical in other branches:

![Sparkasse Jena](/screenshots/sparkasse_jena.png "Sparkasse Jena")

The rules are as such:

* Only 5 characters
* Small letters (a-z)
* Large letters (A-Z)
* Numbers (0-9)
* „Special“ characters: ä,ö,ü,Ä,Ö,Ü and ß (Not suprising for a german Company)

After the rules there some hints on how the password should not look like:

* Combinations of your initials and the birthyear
* Your phone number or parts thereof
* Your zipcode
* Commom combinations like 123ab or 55555
* Full or parts of your login credentials

### [Synchrony Financial](https://consumercenter.mysynchrony.com/consumercenter/securityinfoaction_change_password_review_cancel.do)

### [Virgin Media](https://my.virginmedia.com/forgot-details/reset)

### [Virgin Trains](https://www.buytickets.virgintrains.co.uk/buytickets/updatepersonaldetails.aspx#customerDetails)

Your password needs to be between 8 and 10 characters long. Previously this would silently truncate the password without warning, causing confusion when the password wouldn't work.

### [Williams-Sonoma](https://secure.williams-sonoma.com/account/updatepassword.html)
We put punctuation in the list of unusable characters to make it additionally confusing.
