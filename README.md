### [Izly by Crous](https://mon-espace.izly.fr/Home/Logon)

Izly by Crous is an __imposed__ French payment service for the university. You can't pay your daily meal without that because yeah you know cash is an ancient dumb thing.

Your username is firstname.lastname@youruniversity.fr or your phone number. We only allow you a fixed 6 numbers password. Oh yeah we also block your account after three failed atempts. How convenient when the only thing you need to know is the name of someone and where they study. How convenient indeed.

Oh and also look we got pages __NOT TRANSLATED IN FRENCH__ because duh.

![Izly by Crous](/screenshots/izly-by-crous.png "Izly by Crous")

### [Merrill Lynch](https://www.benefits.ml.com/Core/User/ChangePassword)

Passwords must be between 8 and 20 characters, and some special characters are allowed. Users with randomly-generated passwords may find it particularly annoying to generate a password that works for their password safe.

![Merrill Lynch](/screenshots/merrill-lynch.png "Merrill Lynch")

### [Microsoft (work accounts)](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/ChangePassword.aspx)

What doesn't seem to be a problem for personal accounts, is for work accounts from Microsoft (e.g. Office 365 etc.).

Maximum 16 characters. So forget about using your new fancy diceware password here - or really any secure passwords in general.

Oh - and besides that, please don't use any "exotic" symbols, like ¤ or €. Or the letters Æ, Ø or Å from the Danish alphabet. They all are supposedly "spaces".

![Microsoft (work accounts)](/screenshots/microsoftwork.png "Microsoft (work accounts)")

### [Mindware](https://secure.mindware.orientaltrading.com/web/login/createUser)

You "_may use special characters_", but only some of them - and we won't necessarily tell you which ones.

![Mindware](/screenshots/mindware1.png "Mindware")
![Mindware](/screenshots/mindware2.png "Mindware")

### [MKB NetBankár](https://www.mkbnetbankar.hu/)

It only accepts lowercase letters, uppercase letters and numbers (any other character counts as forbidden character).  
Also, if your password contains any invalid character, it will get marked as "Identical to the former 10 passwords".

To make it more fun, during the registration, it allows to set a 24 characters password to login to their website.  
Once you try to login with the password, it will say that the maximum length accepted is 16 characters.  
What actually happens, is that they let you insert 24 characters during registration, but only the first 16 will get actually used as password.

### [Movistar](https://www.movistar.es/particulares/Privada/Registro/?url=%2Fmimovistar-cliente%2Fes-es%2Fparticulares%2Fregistro%2FdatosUsuario.html&)
Min 7 and max 8 characters for password! Also to be different than the username: the user name is automatically generated and is based on the surname of the user with some characters replaced by digits :)

Has been that way for more than 10 years.

![Movistar](/screenshots/movistar.jpg "Movistar")

### [Oracle](https://profile.oracle.com/)

### [Sparkasse](https://s-jena.de)

„Sparkasse“ is a group of banks which is pretty popular in Germany. It calls its passwords „PIN“ („persönliche Identifikations-Nummer“ — personal identification number), the rules are pretty horrific and its not even a number, even though it is called as such! Here is a screenshot from the branch where I am from (Jena, Germany), but since they have a central IT, I think it will be identical in other branches:

![Sparkasse Jena](/screenshots/sparkasse_jena.png "Sparkasse Jena")

The rules are as such:

* Only 5 characters
* Small letters (a-z)
* Large letters (A-Z)
* Numbers (0-9)
* „Special“ characters: ä,ö,ü,Ä,Ö,Ü and ß (Not suprising for a german Company)

After the rules there some hints on how the password should not look like:

* Combinations of your initials and the birthyear
* Your phone number or parts thereof
* Your zipcode
* Commom combinations like 123ab or 55555
* Full or parts of your login credentials

### [Sprint](https://mysprint.sprint.com)

### [University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/)
