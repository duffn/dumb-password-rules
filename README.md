### [Williams-Sonoma](https://secure.williams-sonoma.com/account/updatepassword.html)

### [Virgin Media](https://my.virginmedia.com/forgot-details/reset)
Your password needs to be between 8 and 10 characters long, with no spaces, and must contain only numbers and letters. The first character must be a letter.
